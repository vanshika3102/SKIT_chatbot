Mapping the Relationship between POs, PSOs and COs \nThe correlation value for all PO-PSO with all the courses (theory, practical, Seminar, Project, \nIndustrial training) for all the semesters is determined by considering each course separately. The \nsteps are given below: \nStep 1: Draft Competencies (CAs) and Performance Indicators (PIs) for all POs-PSOs. \nStep 2: The correlation value of a particular PO-PSO (say POj) with CO under consideration (say \nCOi) is calculated as a number of correlated PIs (say PIjk) divided by the total PIs (\u2211 PIjk) \nof that particular POj \nThe relationship between PO-PSO and CO can be classified as low (1), medium (2), high (3) \naccording "}, {"source": "PDF: policy.pdf", "content": "he relationship between PO-PSO and CO can be classified as low (1), medium (2), high (3) \naccording to the following rubric as given in Table II \nTable II \u2013 Rubric for mapping PO-PSO with CO \nRatio \nMapping \nIf   0 < ratio \u2264 0.33 \nLow (1) \nIf   0.33 < ratio \u2264 0.67 \nMedium (2) \nIf   0.67 < ratio \u2264 1.00 \nHigh (3) \nExample: If CO1 of a particular course satisfies 2 PIs out of total defined 5 PIs of PO1, then the \nratio is 2/5 i.e 0.4 which lies between 0.33 & 0.67. \nHence mapping of CO1 with PO1 is 2 \nTable III below depicts correlation matrix for all COs for a particular course with POs and PSOs as \nobtained using step 1 and step 2. \nTable III \u2013 Weighted Average Matrix for a Single Course \nPOs \n \n    COs \nPO1 \nPO2 \nPO3 \nPO4 \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \nPO12 \nPSO1 \nPSO2 \nCO1 \n2 \n1 \n- \n- \n \n- \n2 \n1 \nCO2 \n3 \n- \n1 \n"}, {"source": "PDF: policy.pdf", "content": " \n \n    COs \nPO1 \nPO2 \nPO3 \nPO4 \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \nPO12 \nPSO1 \nPSO2 \nCO1 \n2 \n1 \n- \n- \n \n- \n2 \n1 \nCO2 \n3 \n- \n1 \n- \n \n3 \n- \n- \n                        \n19 \n \nCO3 \n1 \n2 \n- \n- \n \n2 \n1 \n3 \nCO4 \n- \n- \n2 \n- \n \n- \n2 \n1 \nCO5 \n- \n2 \n1 \n2 \n \n1 \n2 \n2 \nWeighted \nAverage \n2 \n2 \n2 \n2 \n \n2 \n2 \n2 \nIn Table III weighted average for the course under consideration is calculated for every PO-\nPSO by summing relationship number (1, 2 or 3) for all COs of that course and dividing it by the \nmaximum attainable value of the COs that have correlation with that particular PO-PSO. \n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\u210e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52= \n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5c. \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc56 \u00d7 3 \nIn the example under consideration PO1 has correlation with CO1, CO2 and CO3.
